        <article>
            <p>Hi everyone, I'm Gregg Brown and I want to share with you my personal project: building a personal website for myself.</p>
            <p>I've always wanted to have a place where I can showcase my skills, interests and achievements, and also connect with other people who share my passions. That's why I decided to create my own website from scratch, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I learned a lot along the way. </p>
            <p>In this article, I'll tell you more about how I planned, designed and coded my website, and what I hope to achieve with it in the future.</p>
